I've used mencoder to pipe the played bytes to a file. Then I measured the size of the file and divided by the length of the video in seconds. Here are the average bitrates:

Average bitrate for 1080p: 3815.355 kbit/s
Average bitrate for 720p: 1777.294 kbit/s
Average bitrate for 480p: 814.974 kbit/s
Average bitrate for 360p: 395.506 kbit/s
Average bitrate for 240p: 242.416 kbit/s
Average bitrate for 144p: 108.697 kbit/s
