I've used mencoder to pipe the played bytes to a file. Then I measured the size of the file and divided by the length of the video in seconds. Here are the average bitrates:

Average bitrate for 1080p: 488638 B/s
Average bitrate for 720p: 220503 B/s
Average bitrate for 480p: 100500 B/s
Average bitrate for 360p: 48537 B/s
Average bitrate for 240p: 30304 B/s
Average bitrate for 144p: 13588 B/s
